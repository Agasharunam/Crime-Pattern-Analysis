Crime Pattern Analysis – Project Description

🔍 Project Overview
The Crime Pattern Analysis project focuses on identifying meaningful insights, trends, and patterns from crime-related datasets. Using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques, the project aims to understand how crimes are distributed across time, location, and category. This analysis helps in predicting crime-prone areas and supporting law enforcement decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
To analyze historical crime data and uncover hidden patterns.
To identify crime hotspots using clustering methods.
To examine relationships between variables like location, time, and crime type.
To build predictive or descriptive models for crime pattern detection.
To visualize crime trends for easier interpretation.

Dataset Description:
The dataset typically contains features such as:
 Crime Type (Assault, Theft, Burglary, etc.)
 Location / Area
 Date & Time
 Latitude & Longitude
 Crime Description / Report Details
 Exact columns depend on the dataset used, but the workflow supports any standard crime dataset.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Python
NumPy & Pandas – Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning (clustering or prediction models)
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment
